/**
 * Find the watch-recorded Garmin activity a Hevy workout belongs to.
 *
 * This is the matcher the MERGE path needs, and it is a different question from
 * the one `match.ts` answers. That one asks "has this workout already been
 * uploaded", and a timestamp is enough. This one asks "which activity was the
 * user's watch recording of this same session", which a timestamp alone cannot
 * decide: the watch is started and stopped by hand, so it drifts from Hevy by
 * minutes at both ends. Matching on an exact start time, as the engine did
 * before, finds nothing unless both clocks agree to the second.
 *
 * Ported from `find_matching_garmin_activity` in `src/hevy2garmin/garmin.py`.
 * Scoring and every rejection rule are kept identical, so a workout that merged
 * under the Python dashboard merges here too.
 *
 * Pure by design: the caller fetches the candidate activities and passes them
 * in. That keeps the rules testable without a Garmin account, which is the only
 * way to cover the rejection paths at all.
