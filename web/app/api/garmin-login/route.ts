 * POST /api/garmin-login
 * Body: { email, password }
 *
 * Step 1 of the Garmin sign-in. Sends the credentials to the direct-login
 * Cloudflare Worker (which runs the SSO from a non-blocked edge IP), and on a
 * clean success persists the returned DI tokens into platform_credentials
 * ('garmin_tokens') via DBTokenStore so the sync engine can use them. The
 * password is forwarded to the Worker only to obtain a token and is never
 * stored or echoed back.
 *
 * When the account has two-factor enabled the Worker returns needs_mfa with a
 * session_id; the client then posts the code to /api/garmin-login-mfa.
